# Phase 1: Single Ship

The player starts with a starter ship, with poor weapons, defenses, and cargo space. No warp drive is available, which limits the ship to the starting system.

This ship can be upgraded with better weapons, armor, shields, cargo space, and special upgrades. Each ship has different maximums.

All ships can warp once a drive is installed.

## Tasks

With a single ship, there are different tasks available. Each provides income and unique resources.

### Mining

Drill into asteroids, collect ore for sale.

#### Availability

Infinite

#### Income

Normal, dependent on value of ore and price in system

### Trading

Buy low, sell high. Can be within or across systems.

#### Availability

Infinite

#### Income

Normal, dependent on value of trade routes

### Exploration

Find new systems. Changes best available task

#### Availability

Possibly infinite, but memory could be an issue.
Maybe limit systems to inhabited ones

### Mining theft

Mine high-value belts which have claimed by someone else. Dangerous, but pays much better.

#### Availability

Finite over time / system

#### Income

High, dependent on value of ore and price in system.

### Piracy

#### Availability

Higher income. Finite over time, requires cooldown

#### Income

Higher income. Can get components not available on the market.

### Smuggling

#### Availability

Finite over time, requires cooldown

#### Income

Higher income. Can be traded for crypto(?)

## Ship

The player's ship can be upgraded, and new ships can be purchased for use in different tasks. There is no need to fly to where the ship is stored (look, that's no fun, call it 2 day delivery).

Ships have stats:

- Speed
- Cargo space
- Shields
- Hull
- Fuel
- Hardpoints: Gun, Missile, Torpedo
- Countermeasures

## Speed

Speed determines how quickly a ship can fly in combat. Faster ships can close distance in less time, and can better evade guns and missiles.

## Shields

Shields protect against pulse weapons and missiles. These regenerate over time.

## Hull

Hull protects against coilguns and missiles. This can be repaired over time, but more slowly than shields.

## Guns

Different guns do different damage to hull vs. shields. A balance of the two is recommended.

Guns have stats:

- Shield damage
- Hull damage
- Energy used
- Range

### Pulse

Pulse weapons do heavy damage to shields, but limited damage to hull.

### Coilgun

Coilguns do heavy damage to hull, but limited damage to shields.

## Missiles

Missiles are long-ranged, highly accurate, and do equal shield/hull damage against smaller ships.

## Torpedoes

Torpedoes are used against large ships (freighters, capital ships). Without these, certain fights can't be won at all.

Missions involving large ships won't be attempted without the required number of torpedoes.

## Cargo

Cargo space is in m3, no Tetris.
Smuggling compartments are separate from main cargo.

Some commodities require more cargo space than a smaller ship can provide.

## Fuel

Fuel capacity determines how many warp jumps can be made before needing to refuel. All warp-capable ships are equipped with warp scoops to collect fuel from stars.

No fuel is used for intra-system travel.

## Countermeasures

Countermeasures allow a better chance to evade missiles or torpedoes.

# Automation

Task completion is _always_ automated.
